Learn the features, tools, and processes of **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** with the help of step-by-step, guided tutorials.

## Looking to get started?

Do you have O3DE installed and you aren't sure where to start? How about creating the classic "Pong"? Follow this first project tutorial series and learn the basics of O3DE in the process.

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Create your first O3DE game: Pong](first-project/) | Start from a new O3DE project and build your first game: Pong! What's "Pong"? Two paddles square off, in a ball-based battle to land the highest score. This tutorial series will introduce you to basic game UI development, scripting, and controls in O3DE. |

## Artificial Intelligence

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [2D Navigation with Kythera AI](ai/navigation-2d) | Create an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that performs ground-based navigation and follows a visually scripted behavior tree. This tutorial uses the broad toolset that the [Kythera AI Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/kythera-ai) provides. |

## Assets

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Customize Mesh Asset Processing](assets/mesh-assets) | Use **Scene Settings** to process mesh assets for O3DE. |
| [Process PhysX Collider Assets](assets/physx-colliders) | Use Scene Settings to process PhysX collider assets for O3DE. |

## Entities and prefabs

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Entity and Prefab Basics](entities-and-prefabs/entity-and-prefab-basics) | Learn the basics of creating and modifying entities and prefabs. |
| [Spawn and Despawn a Prefab](entities-and-prefabs/spawn-a-prefab.md) | Use **Script Canvas** to create a script that spawns and despawns a prefab. |

## Environments

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Create a Level](environments/create-a-level) | Create a level for O3DE. |

## Extend O3DE Editor

Extend **O3DE Editor** by creating a custom tool Gem. A tool is a dockable widget or dialog window that implements functionality in the Editor. You can create custom tools in C++ or Python.

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Create a Custom Tool Gem in C++](extend-the-editor/shape-example-cpp.md) | Extend the Editor by creating a custom tool Gem that's written in C++. Learn how to use the **CppToolGem** template, and practice C++ development with [Qt](https://wiki.qt.io/Main), the O3DE Tools UI API, and other O3DE APIs. |
| [Create a Custom Tool Gem in Python](extend-the-editor/shape-example-py.md) | Extend the Editor by creating a custom tool Gem that's written in Python. Learn how to use the **PythonToolGem** template, and practice Python development with [Qt](https://wiki.qt.io/Main), the O3DE Tools UI API, and other O3DE APIs.|

## Multiplayer

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [Your First Network Component](multiplayer/first-multiplayer-component) | Create multiplayer components with C++ in this introduction to network components. |

## PhysX

Create physics simulations in O3DE with NVIDIA's PhysX system. The tutorials in this section demonstrate how to use PhysX to add dynamic physics simulations in your projects.

| Topic | Description |
| - | - |
| [Create Wind Forces](physx/wind-provider) | Simulate a wind force with a **PhysX Force Region** and NVIDIA Cloth. |

## PostFX

| Tutorial | Description |
| - | - |
| [PostFX Shape Weight Modifier](postfx/use-postfx-shape-weight-modifier) | Use a **PostFX Shape Weight Modifier** component to modify exposure control in O3DE. This example demonstrates how to modify post-processing effects (PostFX) at runtime. |
