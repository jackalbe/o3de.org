**Asset Processor** starts automatically with **Open 3D Engine (O3DE) Editor**, and runs as a background process. Asset Processor provides many asset related functions including the following:

* Detect new or updated source assets.
* Send **Create Jobs** requests to appropriate **Asset Builders**.
* Schedule process jobs provided by Asset Builders.
* Manage the process job queue.
* Provide status, logs, and messages about asset process jobs.
* Place generated product assets and related data in the **Asset Cache**.
* Send notifications when product assets have been updated so they can be hot reloaded by **O3DE Editor**, tools, and runtimes.
* Provide tools to retrieve information about source assets and product assets.
* Track source dependencies, job dependencies, and product dependencies.

With Asset Processor, a **Launcher** can be run on a target platform without deploying assets to that platform. Instead, the assets are accessed from the Asset Cache on a connected host platform. Asset Processor communicates through a USB connection with mobile target platforms using proxy requests.

On a host platform, connections between Asset Processor and O3DE Editor are automatically maintained.

When you launch software that requires an Asset Processor connection, such as the O3DE Editor or Launcher in a non-release configuration, Asset Processor is automatically launched. If Asset Processor has been launched this way, it automatically shuts down when you close the Editor or Launcher.

{{< note >}}
Symbolic links are not supported when using Asset Processor. To ensure that Asset Processor works properly, follow these guidelines:

* Do not use a symbolic link for your Asset Cache directory.
* Do not use symbolic links for scan directories.
* Use a unique Asset Cache directory.
* Do not share the Asset Cache directory with another host platform that is also running Asset Processor.
