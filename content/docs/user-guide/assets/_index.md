Topics in this section cover the **Asset Pipeline** and asset processing, including what source assets are, how they are discovered and tracked, and how they are processed into runtime optimized product assets. There are also guides for **Asset Processor**, which manages the Asset Pipeline, as well as the **Scene Settings** and **Texture Settings** tools, that customize source asset processing. The final guide explains how to create custom **Asset Builders** with **Python Asset Builder**.

| Topic Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Asset Pipeline](pipeline) | The Asset Pipeline is the end-to-end process that transforms source assets into runtime optimized product assets. |
| [Asset Processor](asset-processor) | Asset Processor discovers source assets, manages asset process jobs, and maintains the **Asset Cache**. |
| [Scene Settings](scene-settings) | Use Scene Settings to customize how meshes, actors, motions, and PhysX colliders are processed. |
| [Texture Settings](texture-settings) | Use Texture Settings to customize how source image assets are processed. |
| [Python Asset Builder](builder) | With Python Asset Builder, you can create custom Asset Builders for known file types. |
| [Asset Types](asset-types) | This table lists O3DE's supported source asset types and the product assets they generate. |
