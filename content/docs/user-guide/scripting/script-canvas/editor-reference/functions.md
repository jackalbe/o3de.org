description: Create reusable functions in Script Canvas that can be inserted into other graphs as nodes.

The **Script Canvas Editor** enables you to create reusable graphs, called functions. A function is available for use as a node in your Script Canvas graphs. Similar to functions in traditional programming languages, functions in the Script Canvas Editor promote code reuse and abstraction. They help simplify your graphs by replacing a group of nodes that perform a specific task with one function node. For example, you could move a series of nodes that perform linear interpolation into a function called Interpolate, and move nodes that perform acceleration clamping into a function called ClampAcceleration. Additionally, if you're using this functionality in multiple graphs, functions make updates easier because you need to make changes only in one place.

Your function appears alongside all the other Script Canvas nodes in the **Node Palette**, categorized under **Global Functions**.

When you create a function, you define the input and output variables of that function, and all the nodes in between that produce a result.

## Creating a Script Canvas function

Start creating a new function by choosing **File**, **New Script** in the Script Canvas Editor.

Alternatively, you can create a new script using the create button located in the upper right corner of the editor canvas.

### Function entry and exit points

Functions require entry and exit points. To create these points, right-click a node's input or output execution slot and select **Expose** in the context menu. Typically, you create an entry point node from the input execution slot of the first node in your function, and an exit point node from the output execution slot of the last node in your function.

To change the names of the execution slots on the function's node, edit the name field on the entry point or exit point node.

Optionally, if you're not certain how you want to connect an entry or exit point to the rest of your function, you can create an entry or exit point node using the toolbar buttons: ![Function toolbar buttons](/images/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/function-toolbar-buttons.png). Connect its execution slot later, when you're ready.

### Function data parameters

Functions can also have input and output data parameters. Input parameters are the values that are passed in to the function. Output parameters are the values that are returned by the function. These are both defined as variables in the **Variable Manager**. A function can also have local variables, which are not exposed on the function's node.

![Create function data parameters with variables in the Variable Manager.](/images/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/function-create-parameter.gif)

The scope of a variable determines if and where the variable will appear on the function node.

| Scope | Location on Node | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | (None) | This is a local variable, for use only by the function. |
| In | Input slot | This is an input parameter. A value for this variable is passed in to the function. |
| Out | Output slot | This is a result variable. The function returns its value as a result. |
| In / Out | Both sides | This is an input parameter that can be modified by the function and returned as a result. |

## Using a Script Canvas function in a graph

Once a Script Canvas function has been saved, it automatically shows up in the **Node Palette**, under **Global Functions**. The default directory for new functions is your project's `scriptcanvas\functions` directory. If you save them in a subdirectory, or save them under a different project directory, the directory structure is used to categorize the functions within **Global Functions**.

Using a function is just like using any other node in Script Canvas. Simply drag and drop the function into a graph. When it's dropped, a node that represents the function is displayed on the canvas.

## Function example: Linear interpolation

In this example, we create a linear interpolation function. This function is represented by the formula: *Result = Start + Time \* (End - Start)*.

In this example you will learn how to do the following:

+ Create entry and exit points for a function.
+ Create input parameter slots.
+ Create return values.

The final function graph should look like this:

![After completing the steps in this example, you should end up with a linear interpolation function.](/images/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/function-linear-interpolation.png)

1. Start a new function using **File**, **New Script** or by using the function create button in the upper right corner of the canvas.

1. Click the left side **Create execution nodeling** button to make an input node on the canvas.

1. Click the **+** button next to Add data input to add an input parameter to the execution nodeling. This will prompt you for a name and type of the new variable. Enter **Start** as the name and **Number** as the type. Repeat this twice more for **Time** and **End**

1. In the Node Inspector expand the Math category.

1. Drag an **Add**, **Subtract**, and **Multiply** node onto the canvas and arrange them similar to the image above.

1. Using [variable references](/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/editor-reference/variables/variable-references), do the following:

   a. In the **Subtract** node, reference the *End* and *Start* variables, so that *Start* is subtracted from *End*.

   b. In the **Multiply** node, use the result of the subtraction and reference the *Time* variable, so that *(End - Start)* is multiplied by *Time*.

   c. In the **Add** node, use the result of the multiplication and reference the *Start* variable, so that these two values are added together. 

1. Create an exit point for your function.

   a. Click the right side **Create execution nodeling** button to make an output node on the canvas.

   b. Click the **+** button next to Add data output to add an input parameter to the output execution nodeling. This will prompt you for a name and type of the new variable. Enter **Result** as the name and **Number** as the type.

   c. **Result** will appear in the list of variables under the Variable Manager. Drag it onto the canvas and select **Set Result** from the menu that appears.
   
   d. Drag the new setter node between the the **Add** node and the output execution nodeling.

1. Drag a connection from the **Add** node output to the **Result** node **In** connector. Drag the **Add** node's Result pin to the **Result** node's number value.

1. Drag the **Result** node's out connector to the output execution nodeling's in connector. 

1. Finally, use **File**, **Save** to save the function and name it **Interpolate**. The function is now ready to use in a Script Canvas graph:
