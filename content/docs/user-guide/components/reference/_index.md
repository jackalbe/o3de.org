Components add functionality to entities in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**. An entity can contain any number or combination of components. Some components allow only one instance per entity, and some depend on other components to function.

Components are provided by Gems. To make a component available in **O3DE Editor**, you must add the Gem that provides the component. Though components might belong to the same type, they might not be provided by the same Gem. You can find out which Gem provides a component in the reference topic for the component.

## Add a component to an entity

To add a component to an entity in O3DE Editor:

1. In **Entity Outliner** or **Perspective**, click an entity to select it. This will show the entity's details in **Entity Inspector**. 
1. In Entity Inspector, choose **Add Component**.
1. Select a component from the component list to add to the entity. 

{{< note >}}
If you can't find a component in the **Add Component** list, you may need to enable the Gem that provides the component and rebuild your project.
