Open 3D Engine uses an abstracted interface layer, the `AzNetworking` framework, to provide access to OS-level networking interfaces. This layer provides access to features like network compression, encryption, and reliable UDP packets.

For a quick introduction to the O3DE network layer and Multiplayer Gem, watch the video below.
