Console variables (CVARs) can be used to set various editor and runtime options in O3DE.

O3DE ships with many in-built CVARs including extensive [debugging CVARs](./debugging).

## Working with CVARs
You can define your own CVARs in code using the [CVAR macro functions](/docs/user-guide/programming/az-console/#console-variables-cvars).

You can invoke CVARs in the Editor via the [console](/docs/user-guide/editor/console/) or in a launcher using the [debug viewport console](/docs/user-guide/appendix/cvars/debugging/#using-console-debug-views)

You can also pass CVARs on the command line when launching O3DE binaries via `--{cvar name} {value}` or `--{cvar name}={value}`. For example, `ServerLauncher.exe --sv_somebool=true`.

## Common CVAR prefixes
O3DE prefers to use the following prefixes for certain groups of CVARs:

| Prefix | Usage                                                                        |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bg_    | *B*oth *G*ames, for common CVARs that can be used on both client and server. |
| cl_    | For client only CVARs.                                                       |
