Get started with **Atom Renderer** through **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** by creating a new *O3DE project* or building **Atom Sample Viewer**, Atom's standalone application. 

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a new O3DE project or Atom Sample Viewer, you must install O3DE on your computer. Follow the instructions in [Set up Open 3D Engine](/docs/welcome-guide/setup) in the Get Started Guide.


## O3DE project

Creating an O3DE project provides you the full suite of O3DE tools, including **O3DE Editor**, **Material Editor**, and a collection of Gems essential to building a simulation or game. This is a great way to test out Atom's features among other objects and mechanics in a level.

### Setup 

1. Follow the instructions in [Project Creation](/docs/welcome-guide/create/) in the Get Started guide. After creating an O3DE project, you have access to Atom via the **Atom Gem**. This is a core Gem that's built into O3DE and enabled in your project by default.

1. After you set up your project, check out the following pages to explore Atom's features via O3DE Editor:
   - [Create a Level](/docs/learning-guide/tutorials/environments/create-a-level/): An introduction to your first level. Whenever you create a level in your project, the default environment consists of many Atom components. 
   - [Component Reference -- Atom](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/#atom): The full list of Atom components that the Atom Gem provides. 


## Atom Sample Viewer

Atom Sample Viewer is a good place to start if you're interested in evaluating Atom's features in a controlled environment. It's a standalone application, so you don't need to open it with O3DE Editor. It showcases samples that demonstrate each feature individually with parameters you can tweak and configure.

### Setup

1. In a command line window, clone the [`o3de-atom-sampleviewer`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de-atom-sampleviewer) repository onto your local machine.

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/o3de/o3de-atom-sampleviewer.git
    ```

1. Update your local repository by pulling the the latest changes, if any.

    ```cmd    
    git pull origin main
    ```

1. Use CMake to generate a Visual Studio solution. In the next step, you build the Atom project using this solution.

    ```cmd
    cmake -B build/windows_vs2019 -S . -G "Visual Studio 16" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=C:/o3de-packages
    ```

1. Use CMake to build `AtomSampleViewerStandalone`. Specify the `profile` configuration for your build.

    ```cmd
    cmake --build build/windows_vs2019 --target AtomSampleViewerStandalone --config profile -- -m
    ```

When the project is done building, you can find the build files in the directory `o3de-atom-sampleviewer/build/bin/profile/`. From there, you can launch `AtomSampleViewerStandalone.exe`.
